## Music

Having played piano and the violin since I was 4, music has always been a big part of my life. Even though I rarely get the chance to play properly nowadays, I still love listening to and finding [cool, new music](https://open.spotify.com/user/sawittan).

## Photography

I've always liked taking photos when I'm on trips. Recently I've decided to get [more serious about it](https://www.instagram.com/tansawit/).

## Anime

Was really crazy about it in high school and first 2 years of college. I was probably keeping up with 10+ shows every week. But then things get in the way and I kinda have fallen out of it. Mostly. A shame really.

## Optimization

This most likely really started when I found [Nikita Voloboev](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/) and his approach towards automating his setup and workflow. The thought of achieving this you do consistently in as little steps as possible appeals to me and what steps I have taken towards that goal thus far has been really satisfying.

## Cool Software/Apps/Tools

Here are a few of them:

- Alfred - Mac Spotlight boosted.

- 2Do - Love the smart filtering capabilities.

- PyCharm - Amazing code navigation, refactoring, optimization.

- MindNode - Awesome mindmapping app.
  
- RamboxPro - Helps to slightly improve incurable Chrome tab situation. Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Discord and so many other web apps all in one place.

Here's the [full list](https://github.com/tansawit/my-mac-setup) of the apps I use for those interested.

## Quotes

Some of the quotes that I love. Gathered from books, talks, articles.

### Happiness

Most of these came from [Darius Forous](https://dariusforoux.com/). I found him on [Medium](https://medium.com/@dariusforoux) but recently found the articles on [his website](https://dariusforoux.com/blog/). Needless to say, both are incredible.

- The problem with pursuing happiness is that we’re constantly moving the goalposts for how we expect to feel.
- If you live below your potential, give up, and never reach for anything better, you will always be miserable.
- But time moves in one direction, and unhappy moments pass.
- So instead of chasing happiness, commit to making your world better, more whole.
- The problem with pursuing happiness is that we’re constantly moving the goalposts for how we expect to feel.
