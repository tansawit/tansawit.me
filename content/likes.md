## Music

Having played piano and the violin since I was 4, music has always been a big part of my life. Even though I rarely get the chance to play properly nowadays, I still love listening to and finding [cool, new music](https://open.spotify.com/user/sawittan).

## Photography

I've always liked taking photos when I'm on trips. Recently I've decided to get [more serious about it](https://www.instagram.com/tansawit/).

## Anime

Was really [crazy about it](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/ValtyreZ?status=2&tag=) in high school and first 2 years of college. I was probably keeping up with 10+ shows every week. But then things get in the way and I kinda have fallen out of it except for 1-2 episodes a week. A shame really.

## Optimization

This most likely really started when I found [Nikita Voloboev](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/) and his approach towards automating his setup and workflow. The thought of achieving this you do consistently in as little steps as possible appeals to me and what steps I have taken towards that goal thus far has been really satisfying.

## Cool Software/Tools

Here are a few of them:

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - Mac Spotlight boosted.

- [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/) - Love the smart filtering capabilities.

- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)/[NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) - Just started using it but love the idea of being able to use just my keyboard to navigate files/codes etc.

- [Notion](https://notion.so/) - Also a new addition. Trying to use it to store all the things related to my productive side (i.e. meeting notes, project timelines, repo status etc.).

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - Amazing code navigation, refactoring, optimization.

- [MindNode](https://mindnode.com/) - Awesome mindmapping app.
  
- [Biscuit](https://eatbiscuit.com/) - Helps (slightly) improve the incurable Chrome tab situation. Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Discord and other web apps all in one place.

Here's the [full list](https://github.com/tansawit/my-mac-setup) of the apps I use for those interested.
