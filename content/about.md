## Sawit Trisirisatayawong

A recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Michigan now based in Bangkok, I develop chatbots and customer analytics tools for local businesses to integrate into social media channels to help them acquire customers, engage and retain those customers, and better understand their customer base.

I also occasionally consult to small and early/seed-stage startups, helping them refine their ideas and product implementations, develop their business models, and improve their understanding of their markets.

In my spare time I like to analyse and visualize [interesting datasets](/projects), watch movies, TV shows, and anime, read books, listen to music and podcasts, and take photos.
