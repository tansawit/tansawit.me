- Finally got to use Go at work. Really loving the language but definitely a change coming from Python. Even more so when part of the job is to transpile a Python API into Go, given the dynamic vs static typing nature of the two.

- Also started to reconsider whether to go into data science. Might just stick with software/backend for now.

- Started building my own information storage and retrieval [system](https://github.com/notelog). Will be a good chance to learn and try things across the stack, especially ElasticSearch, frontend/React, and potentially mobile development.

- Finished reading my first book in a while. Definitely [recommend it](https://tansawit.me/posts/2020/02/anything-you-want-sivers-review/). Guess I still have somewhat of an attention span.
