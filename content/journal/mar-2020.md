## 4 March 2020

- Accepted an offer with [Band Protocol](https://bandprotocol.com). Definitely the hardest I've prepped for interviews. Can't wait to work in a real startup environment again, especially one that is [open-source by nature](https://github.com/bandprotocol) and after having met the founders and hearing amazing reviews from people in the industry.
