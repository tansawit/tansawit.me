My projects to date include:

## CubeSat Engineering Model

As part of Dr Tippawan Wanwiwake's research at the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology and Development Agency ([GISTDA](https://gistda.or.th/main/en)), I took part in assembling and programming an engineering model of an Arduino-based 1U CubeSat to potentially be used in natural disaster trracking, management, and remediation.

Prior to that, as part of my internship with the agency, I compiled a literature review examining the practicality and feasibility of adopting the platform for use in Thailand, outlining its history, technical specifications and previous use cases.

## Rapper Lyrics Matching Model

Done as the final project for the University of Michigan's EECS486 (Introduction to Information Retrieval) class.

The [project](https://github.com/tansawit/rap-artist-classifier) examines the effectiveness of various classification models in matching rap lyrics to the correct artists.

The accompanying [web application](https://github.com/tansawit/rap-match) allows users to input their own lyrics string, choose the classification model to use, and outputs the name of the artist with the closest lyrics features.

## JARVIS Personal Assistant Chatbot

A chatbot built on top of the LINE messaging platform's Messaging API and Google's Dialogflow. It integrates and scrapes data from various services and locations to provide numerous useful features.

The idea for this came from my personal peeve of not liking to need to think about where I need to find something; instead preferring to have as many things accessible from one location as possible.

Current feature set include:

- Current weather and condition
- Directions
- World Clock
- Movies in theaters and showtime

## My macOS Workflow

I share my [macOS](https://github.com/tansawit/my-mac-setup) personal setup that includes all the applications and tools that I use. Along with that is my [dotfiles](https://github.com/tansawit/dotfiles) containing the configuration files for my terminal and editors.
