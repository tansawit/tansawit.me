My projects to date include:

## CubeSat Engineering Model

As part of Dr Tippawan Wanwiwake's research at the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology and Development Agency ([GISTDA](https://gistda.or.th/main/en)), I took part in assembling and programming an engineering model of an Arduino-based 1U CubeSat to examine the practicality and feasibility of adopting the platform to help in natural disaster tracking, management, and remediation.

## Rapper Lyrics Matching Model

Done as the final project for the University of Michigan's EECS486 (Introduction to Information Retrieval) class.

The [project](https://github.com/tansawit/rap-artist-classifier) examines the effectiveness of various classification models in matching rap lyrics to the correct artists.

The accompanying [web application](https://github.com/tansawit/rap-match) allows users to input their own lyrics string, choose the classification model to use, and outputs the name of the artist with the closest lyrics features.

## My macOS Workflow

I share my [macOS](https://github.com/tansawit/my-mac-setup) personal setup that includes all the applications and tools that I use. Along with that is my [dotfiles](https://github.com/tansawit/dotfiles) containing the configuration files for my terminal and editors.
