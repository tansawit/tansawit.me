Some of my projects to date include:

## CubeSat Engineering Model

As part of Dr Tippawan Wanwiwake's research at the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology and Development Agency ([GISTDA](https://gistda.or.th/main/en)), I assisted assembling and programming an engineering model of an Arduino-based 1U CubeSat to potentially be used in natural disaster prevention and relief.

Prior to that, as part of my internship with the agency, I compiled a literature review examining the practicality and feasibility of adopting the platform for use in Thailand.

## Rapper Lyrics Matching Model

Done as the final project for the University of Michigan's EECS486 (Introduction to Information Retrieval) class.

The [project and resulting paper](https://github.com/tansawit/rap-artist-classifier) examines the effectiveness of various classification models in matching rap lyrics to the correct artists.

The accompanying [web application](https://rap-match.herokuapp.com/) allows users to input their own text, choose the classification model to use, and outputs the name of the artist with the closest-matching lyrics features. The source code for the app can be found on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tansawit/rap-match).

## JARVIS Personal Assistant Chatbot

A chatbot built on top of the LINE messaging platform's Messaging API and Google's Dialogflow. It integrates and scrapes data from various services and websites to provide numerous useful features.

Current feature set include:

- Current weather and condition
- Directions
- World Clock
- Movies in theaters and showtime

## Tools

- LINE Notify [service](https://github.com/tansawit/aqi-daily-notify), written in Go, to send daily PM 2.5 values at my home, apartment, and office.

## My macOS Workflow

I share my [macOS](https://github.com/tansawit/my-mac-setup) personal setup that includes all the applications and tools that I use. Along with that is my [dotfiles](https://github.com/tansawit/dotfiles) containing the configuration files for my terminal and editors.
