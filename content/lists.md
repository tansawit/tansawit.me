A collection of things I am currently watching/reading/listening to etc.

## Books

### Philisophy 

- [Tao Te Ching](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679724346?ie=UTF8) - The one book that I’m sure that I’ll reread on and on: each time learning and understanding something new from it. For such a small book, the idea it presents, and the way it is presented is absolutely unmatched.
