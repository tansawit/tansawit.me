## Tools/Apps

Some applications and utilities that I use that others might find useful.

### [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash)

API Documentation browser for Mac. After combining it with [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), the [Dash Alfred workflow](https://github.com/Kapeli/Dash-Alfred-Workflow) and [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/), it has been indispensable for me when looking up language libraries/functions and other things.

### [Sip](https://sipapp.io/)

Whenever I needed to get the color value of some digital assets before, I've always used macOS's built-in Digital Color Meter app. But I always ran into the issue of having no integrated way to store the retrieved colors, let alone multiple color sets or palettes. Sip solves these issue with its color palette manager, a more fully-fledged and easy to use color picker, and cloud sync.

### [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/)

A really nice-looking and modern GUI for databases that supports quite [a lot of databases](https://docs.tableplus.com/#supported-databases), both SQL and NoSQL. Bonus points for having native apps for Mac and Windows. A really refreshing change coming from [Sequel Pro](http://sequelpro.com/). 

Some features are still incomplete/buggy though, like the import functions seems to fail in some cases that Sequel Pro can handle. Plus I hope the app is a little less expensive, but then again I'm using it through my [SetApp subscription](https://setapp.com/). Ultimately, I still think it's completely worth it for anyone who works a lot with databases.

Oh, and it has dark mode support!

### [Vimac](https://vimacapp.com/)

After falling down the Vim rabbit-hole, I've been trying to find ways to use Vim-based/keyboard-only navigations in as many contexts as possible. And other than my terminal, the two contexts that I normally use my mouse are in my browser (Chrome) and general app/program navigation. Having found [Surfingkeys](https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys) for Chrome, I tried to find a similar solution for general button-clicking across app. Thus, enters Vimac.

The app allows you to assign a hotkey which, once pressed, will show a layer of shortcut keys over any recognized clickable elements on the screen (example below). After pressing the desired key combination, the app will simulate a mouse click on that element. Even though the app seems to work pretty well most of the time, its beta status definitely shows. Sometime the assigned keyboard shortcut does not register, and some places that are buttons/navigation are not recognized. But overall I'm definitely with it.

## Books

### Philisophy 

- [Tao Te Ching](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679724346?ie=UTF8) - The one book that I’m sure that I’ll reread on and on: each time learning and understanding something new from it. For such a small book, the idea it presents, and the way it is presented is absolutely unmatched.
